# Lab 6 - NoSQL Databases
Welcome to Lab 6 of the DS-2002 course! This lab will take you through the fundamentals of the primary types of NoSQL Databases we have briefly covered in class:
- **Document**: Use MongoDB to explore Movie data to answer a few questions and practice querying.
- **Time-Series**: Review materials for InfluxDB to understand the application and use of Time-Series data.
- **Graph**: Complete the Neo4j fundamentals certification and add it to your LinkedIn!
- **Vector**: Follow along some code where we build a basic Patient Disease Diagnosis tool from scratch!

## Part 1. Document Databases using MongoDB:
### MongoDB Atlas Free Tier:
- MongoDB Atlas offers a free tier that allows you to create a small cluster. While it's a cloud-hosted service, it's very easy to set up.
- You can find many public datasets that can be easily imported into your free cluster.
- MongoDB also provides interactive tutorials and documentation with sample data.
- If you have not already done so, please watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DbZ2ii01ew&ab_channel=NealMagee) to set up your account.

### Quick Help for MongoDB:
1. Open your free cluster, navigate to your `sample_mflix` database, and see your six (6) collections, each of which containing many documents:
  - comments, embedded_movies, movies, sessions, theaters, users
2. Click on your `movies` collection and use `Find` to query your movies documents
3. Open the [query documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/query-documents/) for help for how to query using MongoDB.
  - (NOTE: The documentation allows you to select a language. By default it will use `Node.js`, switch this to `Compass`.)
4. Copy and paste this query and hit `Apply`:
```
{
"year": { $gt: 1990 },
"cast": "Tom Hanks",
"genres": "Comedy",
"imdb.rating": { $gt: 7.5 },
"metacritic": {$gt: 80}
}
```
  - This should return three documents which consist of the first three Toy Story Movies.
  - With this query, we are searching for any movies that meets these criteria, i.e. All Tom Hanks comedies made after 1990 with critical acclaim on both IMDB (>7.5) and MetaCritic (>80).
  - You may be wondering, "Hey, there were four Toy Stories! Does this mean there is no Toy Story 4 in this collection or did it not do as well, critically?"
5. Try running this:
```
{
"year": { $gt: 1990 },
"cast": "Tom Hanks",
"genres": "Comedy",
"title": { $regex: '^Toy' }
}
```
  - Here we introduce the use of `regex` or Regular Expression, to enhance our search to find all of the Comedic "Toy" movies Tom Hanks has been in since 1990.
  - There are many other ways we could look to prove this, maybe even by getting rid of the genre or year, but we can rest easy knowing that Toy Story 4 is simply not in this dataset.

### Instructions for MongoDB
Please use my natural language sentences to create a Compass query to search within the sample_mflix database. You will need to paste your query as well as provide the answer to the thing I am trying to find.
0. **FOR EXAMPLE**: If I were asking for "All Tom Hanks comedies made after 1990 with critical acclaim on both IMDB (>7.5) and MetaCritic (>80).", I would expect to see the following in your Gist (I will be lenient on formatting, but try to get it close, at least so it is easy to read.):
```
Part 1 (Documents - MongoDB):
  - Query 0:
            {
            "year": { $gt: 1990 },
            "cast": "Tom Hanks",
            "genres": "Comedy",
            "imdb.rating": { $gt: 7.5 },
            "metacritic": {$gt: 80}
            }
  - Answer 0: Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3
```
1. An award winning R-rated Sci-Fi movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger consisting of a "hunt" in the full plot description that IMDB (>6) found favorable, and MetaCritic hated (<40).
2. A G-rated movie, exactly 100 minutes long that came out either after 1980 or before 1940 with at least one "dog" being part of the full plotline.
3. The theaterId of the most northern theater in Charlottesville.

Copy the formatting below and paste into your Gist:
```
  - Query 1: 
  - Answer 1: 
  - Query 2: 
  - Answer 2: 
  - Query 3: 
  - Answer 3:
```

  - Key Concepts (*) if you do not want to watch the whole thing:
    - *What are Time Series Databases and what is Time Series Data: 2:25 - 7:18
    - High Level Applications and Why InfluxData: 7:19 - 10:39
    - *What is InfluxDB: 10:40 - 22:48

    - Summary + Q&A: 48:22 - 1:00:52
11. Watch another quick explanation of [Time-Series](https://youtu.be/KZwr1xBDbBQ).
12. **OPTIONAL**: Click into `Sources` and then `Influx CLI` to setup the CLI to add and play around with some data. Full disclosure, I could not get it working for this lab as the Interface changed on March 1st, so I would need to redo a lot of it. That said, the videos are helpful to give you a rundown, so I have opted for questions related to Time-Series.
13. Answer these Questions:
  - Question 1: In your own words, what is one major benefit to using something like InfluxDB over a normal RDBMS?
  - Question 2: How could/would you use Time-Series to support your interests? Be specific, could be for your hobbies, research, something you just care about. I want you to tell me:
      - What data you would monitor and what interest it would support.
      - How far you would look back and why. (Most recent week, year, the full timespan, etc.)
      - What frequency you would expect this data to come in and how sensitive it would be to specific time. (i.e. Do the nanoseconds matter, by day, by week, etc.)
      - What trends would you expect or hope to see, or what insights would you expect or hope to gain from using this? What would the impact to your interest be?
14. Add your responses to your Gist like so:
```
Question 1: <your answer>
Question 2: <your answer>
```
